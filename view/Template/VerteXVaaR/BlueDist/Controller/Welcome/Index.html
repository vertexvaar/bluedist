            <h1>Welcome to VerteXVaaR.BlueSprints</h1>

            <h2>An experiment gone right :D</h2>

            <p>
                VerteXVaaR.BlueSprints was created in a few hours as an experiment of "what could be done in 3 hours"
                and it's development continued for 6 other hours. After 9 hours it had (all simple) routing, templating,
                of course autoloading (thanks composer) and NoDB persistence, all out of the box. But more is to come.
            </p>

            <h2>It will stay simple!</h2>

            <p>
                This PHP Framework is designed to stay as simple as possible but yet provide some indispensable
                features.
                So there is no Database connection or Dependency Injection and it's not about to come. If you are
                searching
                for
                a framework capable of that, you have to search for another.
            </p>

            <h2>Fast framework, fast Development</h2>

            <p>
                Because there are almost no classes inside of VerteXVaaR.BlueSprints and it has no reflection or
                abstraction
                it is simply fast by design, without any caching.
                This (nearly) slender design is good for performance, but it prevents some features. But if you want to
                develop
                a simple Application that stores a few models or just prints out content you will be convinced by your
                own
                development speed
            </p>

            <h2>Templating</h2>

            <p>
                Templating might be something you have to get used to, because it uses pure PHP. There is nothing fancy
                like
                twig, handlebars.js or TYPO3.Fluid. Just some PHP that is executed right away. Not even cached.
                Here is some data set by the controller. Only for your pleasure ;)
            </p>
            <ul>
                <f:for each="{strings}" as="string">
                    <li>{string}</li>
                </f:for>
            </ul>

            <h2>Persistence?</h2>

            <p>
                Want a demo about Persistence? Just <a href="listFruits">follow me</a> ;)
